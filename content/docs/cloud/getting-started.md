Neon is a public service that hosts PostgreSQL databases and is backed by the Neon Storage Engine.

If you are already familiar with PostgreSQL, you can jump to [Query with psql](../tutorials#query-with-psql) for how to connect to your project with 'psql'. Then look at the examples of how to do branching and Point-in-Time queries.

If you are new to PostgreSQL, look at our [web query editor](../tutorials#query-via-ui) for a primer.

For instructions on how to use Neon with your application stack, see [Integrations](../integrations).
